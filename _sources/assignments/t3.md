## Overview

Finally, the moment you have all been waiting for: functional prototypes! In this assignment, you will be building upon everything you have learned about your scenario, users, and interface design to assemble a functional prototype progressive web app. Your prototype will allow you to clearly demonstrate how, through the iterative design process, you have selected an interface and interaction design space optimized for your users.

Your functional prototype will serve as the point of reference for the eventual implementation of your product. It will also enable you to further refine any remaining obstacles that will affect usability before you move into production.
