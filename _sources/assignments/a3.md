A3: Roll Your Own - Novel Widget
============================

Congrats! You now have a modest toolkit filled with some useful widgets. Now it's time to get creative. For this assignment you will design and implement your own custom widget for your toolkit.

## Overview

At one point during the history of the graphical user interface every common widget we use today was novel. Many of the widgets you created for A2 were adopted from well known and understood interactors from the physical world. For example, the "radio button" metaphor was taken directly from the radio interfaces of the pre-computer era where only one button could be engaged at a time. Just because we have grown accustomed to a common set of widgets in the computer interfaces we interact with today doesn't mean there's no room left to novel points of interaction!

## Assignment Details

Your goal for this assignment will be to envision something different. This doesn't mean that your widget must be original, but it should explore interaction in a way that can not be easily achieved with a standard widget toolkit (HTML, for example).

To make sure you are on the right track, we will be breaking this assignment into two parts: design and implementation.

## Assignment Requirements

### Design

For the first part of the assignment, we want you to design your widget prior to implementation. Grab a piece of paper, use a drawing tool, or a pen and tablet to sketch out how your widget will function. Your sketch doesn't have to be perfect, a back of the napkin style doodle should suffice. The goal is to communicate to the class what it is you intend to create.

Sketches should be submitted to __Slack__ no later than __Monday, May 15th by 11:59 PM__. We will be using your sketch to determine if the novel widget you plan to create meets the criteria of the assignment. The sooner you submit your sketch, the sooner you can feel safe to start on implementation. We will green check your sketch if it is good to go and reply in thread if we want to see more.

### Implementation

Once your sketch is approved, it's time to start writing the code. You will continue using the toolkit from A1 and A2. Just add a new **`.ts`** file to your **`widgets`** directory. By now you should have a solid understanding of what the core toolkit library can accomplish. So make sure you scope your design and implementation such that your vision can be carried out using the limitations of our toolkit.

#### Common Requirements

While there will be many different types of widgets created for this assignment, there are a few requirements that all widgets must fulfill:

1. The widget must display information in some way and allow a user to act upon it (_e.g.,_ a button has a label and can be clicked).
2. The action a user takes should be communicated to calling code via a callback (_e.g.,_ a button is clicked and raises an onClick event)

#### Demo Program

Once your novel widget is complete, instantiate it and provide any necessary usage instructions in the **`index.ts`** file included in your repository from assignment 1. Your demo program should listen to all the exposed event handlers that you created for your widgets and output the information they pass to the browser console. When we grade your assignment, we will open the console and look for these messages to assess whether or not the feature has been implemented.



## Submission

For this assignment you will submit the following items as a zip file to Canvas:

1. Your completed widget **`.ts`** files along with the rest of the starter code as a zip file to Canvas. 
2. A revised index.ts that instantiates and arranges all of your widgets so they can be interacted with by a user.
3. A screenshot of your widgets and UI as it is rendered in the browser. Name your screenshot **`toolkit_novel_widget.png`** (or .jpg, .gif, etc) and place it in the root of your project folder.

Remember to delete all generated files during the setup process (e.g., node_modules) to keep your file size small.

```{admonition} For Your Consideration
:class: tip

A good practice to make habit is to regularly commit your code to a source control system like GitHub as you make progress. You are free to use your github repository as often as you like as you work on the assignment, however, if you need assistance from the course instructors we will ask that you provide us with a link to your GitHub repository and a running instance of your program first.

```

## Grading

Your assignment will be given an overall grade that is based on the completeness of the following items:

* All materials submitted correctly with documentation: 0.25 pts
    * Is a screenshot of the widget and UI included?
* Demo: 0.25 pts
    * Is the index.ts page completed so that a full demonstration of all widgets is available?
* Design: 0.5 pts
    * Was a sketch submitted to Slack by the deadline?
* Completeness of widget : 2 pts 
	* Does the widget function as described?
* Novelty of widget : 2 pts 
	* Is the widget novel or interesting in some way?

Total: 5/5 pts
