## Overview

Today we have a vast ecosystem of toolkits and frameworks to draw (pun intended, sort of.) from when building a software user interface. Frameworks like Angular and React rely upon layers of abstraction to render visual components to a particular viewstate. While these abstractions make it possible for us to quickly build powerful user interfaces, they mask the underlying logic required to perform the most basic interactions. In this assignment, we will be peeling back the layers to improve our understanding of the fundamental logic that make graphical widgets work.

## Assignment Details
When you build a user interface, you might decide that you need a button, a checkbox, a way to capture text input, or one of the many other widgets provided to you by your chosen toolkit. To accomplish this task, you will likely create that widget by writing some code similar to the following (assuming our toolkit of choice is HTML):

%```html
 <button type="button">Click</button> 
%```

and when rendered in a browser we would see something similar to this:

TODO: ADD IMAGE


Pretty straightforward, write some code, build it, and view it. The end result is a nice graphical widget that changes in visual appearance when we interact with it using a mouse or keyboard. But how is this widget actually created?

To complete this assignment you will be required to build your own graphical toolkit. You must build 6 widgets using the basic state machine that we discussed covered in lecture. You may include the button widget used in the lecture demo, updated to match your graphical style, as one of your widgets.

### Widget Requirements

Your 6 widgets must include (visit Wikipedia's [Graphical widget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_widget) page for more detail):
* Button
* Check box
* Radio button
* Text input
* Drop-down list
* Custom (your choice, can be anything!)

## Submission


Your submission must include the following items:

## Grading

Your team will be given an overall grade that is based on thoroughness and thoughtfulness of your story. It is fairly easy to identify rushed or poorly thought out work, so do not wait to the last minute to finalize your assets.

* All materials submitted on time: 0.5 pts
* Submission format requirements met: 0.5 pts
* Completeness of assignment: 9 pts
	* Are all views represented in high fidelity prototypes?
	* Are all evaluations complete?

Total: 10 pts

We will not be penalizing your team for the absence of individual member materials. Missing assets for individual members will be assessed through the participation grade.
