A3: High Fidelity Prototypes
============================

## Overview

Your high fidelity prototypes represent the last phase before moving into production. Before you commit unnecessary time and cost to develop your final prototypes, you will need to make sure that you are heading in the right direction. So for this assignment, you will be required to conduct an expert evaluation on some aspect of your planned user interface and use what you learn to guide the development of your high fidelity prototypes.

## Assignment Details

### Part 1: Preparation

To get started you will review your final low-fidelity wireframes for both web and mobile. Pick one aspect from each that you feel the least confident about. This may be the location of a menu, the layout of a screen, the language you have chosen to describe your interface, or anything else that you feel could be improved. Once you have selected an aspect of both web and mobile, you will design a cognitive walkthrough evaluation.

To conduct a cognitive walkthrough you will need to prepare the following materials:
* Collected interface artifacts to show the evaluator
* A script (see lecture)
* A believability document (filled out during and after evaluation)


### Part 2: Evaluation

With your materials in place, you are now ready to conduct a cognitive walkthrough evaluation with experts. For this assignment you will rely on the growing expertise of your classmates to gather the feedback that you need to confidently move forward with your high-fidelity prototypes. Team pairings have been selected for you and can be found on the project team spreadsheet we have been using this quarter. To ensure that you have enough time to complete your prototypes, you should try to complete your evaluations as soon as possible. Find your team, and schedule a time to meet with each member individually. One good approach might be two set aside two hours for both teams, and schedule each member to arrive for evaluation in 15-20 minute chunks.

A single session will include your full team and 1 person from your matched team. For each session, you will:
* Share the artifact with the evaluator
* Provide a brief description of the artifact
* Ask evaluator to perform each task in your script
* Capture successes, failures, evaluator comments, and other relevant or useful information

A good strategy is to assign on member of your team to be the 'guide' while other members take notes. All members should feel free to ask questions or otherwise follow up with the evaluator when they have a question or see an opportunity to probe deeper.

```{note}
You MUST record your evaluations!
```

You will be recording and submitting all of your evaluations to Canvas. So be prepared and don't forget to record! If you fail to record an evaluation, you will have to conduct it over again. All of your evaluations must be submitted in one video. You are free to assemble this video however you like, but I recommend using the pause recording feature in zoom between evaluation sessions to reduce extraneous work.

### Part 3: Building Prototypes

Now you are ready to start working on your final high fidelity prototypes. Your goal for this phase of development is to settle on the final layout, views, user flows, and visual assets. Your output should closely align with the functional prototypes you will be creating in assignments 4 and 5. A prototype should be created for each unique view in your web and mobile interfaces. Repetitive views (e.g., content changes, but layout remains the same), you will create a user flow that maps to the progression through each view in your interface. 

## Submission

To submit your high fidelity prototypes, appoint one member of your group to be responsible for assembling your final deliverable into a single packet in the PDF format. The packet must start with a cover page that includes (feel free to reuse from a2):

* Your team name
* Scenario summary (one sentence that describes your product)
* Team member names
* NEW: Team member roles for this assignment
* Date

Your submission must include the following items:
* The artifacts you used for your evaluation
* The script(s) used during your evaluation
* A believability report
* A screenshot taken of your recorded session and link to your evaluation recording
* Final high fidelity prototypes and user flow

## Grading

Your team will be given an overall grade that is based on thoroughness and thoughtfulness of your story. It is fairly easy to identify rushed or poorly thought out work, so do not wait to the last minute to finalize your assets.

* All materials submitted on time: 0.5 pts
* Submission format requirements met: 0.5 pts
* Completeness of assignment: 9 pts
	* Are all views represented in high fidelity prototypes?
	* Are all evaluations complete?

Total: 10 pts

We will not be penalizing your team for the absence of individual member materials. Missing assets for individual members will be assessed through the participation grade.
