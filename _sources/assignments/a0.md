A0: Meet and Greet
============================

Learning in a large class setting can make getting to know each other more challenging than smaller in-person classes. So to facilitate our engagement with one another, your first assignment will be to introduce yourself in whatever chat tool we decide to use for this class (we'll figure it out during our first class together).
 
Once you have joined, complete the following tasks:

1. Take a selfie and make it your avatar (roster photos are terrible and rarely help us identify you!). The avatar you set should be of you and clearly identifiable.
2. Introduce yourself in the #introductions channel. Share some fun and interesting facts about yourself with the class. Feel free to share as much or as little as you like. However, at the very least, let everyone know your preferred name and pronouns and why you are interested in this course. Above all be respectful. 

Once you have posted your introduction, take a screenshot, and upload it to the a0 assignment submission page on Canvas to receive credit.
