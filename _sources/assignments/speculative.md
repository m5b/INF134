## Assignment Details


## Submission

To submit your scenario story, appoint one member of your group to be responsible for assembling your final deliverable into a single packet in the PDF format. The packet must start with a cover page that includes:

* Your team name
* Scenario summary (one sentence that describes your product)
* Team member names
* Date

You must also identify each asset that you created in some way. One approach might be to put your name at the bottom of the page (e.g., created by Mark Baldwin). Alternatively, you may group assets by team member and start each section with an introduction page that includes your name. We are not particularly concerned with how you identify your assets, but simply that you do.

## Grading

Your team will be given an overall grade that is based on thoroughness and thoughtfulness of your story. It is fairly easy to identify rushed or poorly thought out work, so do not wait to the last minute to finalize your assets.

* All materials submitted on time: 0.5 pts
* Submission format requirements met: 0.5 pts
* Completeness of assignment: 9 pts

Total: 10 pts

We will not be penalizing your team for the absence of individual member materials. Missing assets for individual members will be assessed through the participation grade.
