A4: Functional Prototype: Mobile
============================

## Overview

Finally, the moment you have all been waiting for: functional prototypes! In assignments 4 and 5 you will be building upon everything you have learned about your scenario, users, and interface design to assemble a functional prototype. Your prototype will allow you to clearly demonstrate how, through the iterative design process, you have selected an interface and interaction design space optimized for your users.

Your functional prototype will serve as the point of reference for the eventual implementation of your product. It will also enable you to further refine any remaining obstacles that will influence usability before you move into production.

## Assignment Details

Your first priority should be completing your functional prototype. Your goal should be to ensure that all interactive elements that you have included in your interface demonstrate your intended interaction. Your individual scenarios will lead to 

* 5 users,   


## Submission

To submit your functional prototype, appoint one member of your group to be responsible for assembling your final deliverable into a single packet in the PDF format. The packet must start with a cover page that includes (feel free to reuse from a3):

* Your team name
* Scenario summary (one sentence that describes your product)
* Team member names
* Team member roles for this assignment
* Date

Your submission must include the following items:
* The artifacts you used for your evaluation
* The script(s) used during your evaluation
* A believability report
* A screenshot taken of your recorded session and link to your evaluation recording
* Final high fidelity prototypes and user flow

## Grading

Your team will be given an overall grade that is based on thoroughness and thoughtfulness of your story. It is fairly easy to identify rushed or poorly thought out work, so do not wait to the last minute to finalize your assets.

* All materials submitted on time: 0.5 pts
* Submission format requirements met: 0.5 pts
* Completeness of assignment: 9 pts
	* Are all views represented in high fidelity prototypes?
	* Are all evaluations complete?

Total: 10 pts

We will not be penalizing your team for the absence of individual member materials. Missing assets for individual members will be assessed through the participation grade.
