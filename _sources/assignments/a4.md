## Overview

Finally, the moment you have all been waiting for: functional prototypes! In this assignment, you will be building upon everything you have learned about your scenario, users, and interface design to assemble functional prototypes for your web and mobile interfaces. Your prototypes will allow you to clearly demonstrate how, through the iterative design process, you have selected an interface and interaction design space optimized for your users.

Your functional prototypes will serve as the point of reference for the eventual implementation of your product. It will also enable you to further refine any remaining obstacles that will affect usability before you move into production.

## Assignment Details

Your first priority should be to complete both your web and mobile functional prototypes. You should ensure that all elements you have included in your interface clearly demonstrate your intended interactions. A user should be able to freely explore your interface without having to perform certain actions in a particular order to achieve an outcome. 

Your interface should appear as realistic as possible. All placeholders, lorem ipsum text, joke data, etc., should be replaced with the type of content you would expect to see during real world use of your product.

If your prototype contains repetitive user flows that reveal the same type of information (**e.g.**, different categories that drill down to detailed content), you do not have to implement functionality for each instance. Implement one or two to demonstrate the intended interaction. Just be sure to make it clear in your user interface which objects are interactive and which are not.

Once your functional prototypes are complete, you are ready to conduct your final evaluation. 

### User Evaluation

For this user evaluation you will be assessing the usability of the interface that you designed by conducting a study using the Retrospective Think Aloud (RTA) protocol discussed in lecture. Your study should be designed such that participants have an opportunity to interact with all critical aspects of your user interface. 

Each team member is responsible for arranging at least 1 participant for the study. All team members should participate in each study. You must conduct 1 more evaluation than you have group members. So, if you have a team of 4, your completed study will consist of a minimum of 5 individual user evaluations.

For each participant you will collect the following demographics:
* Age
* Experience with software interfaces (novice, intermediate, or expert)
* Preferred web browser, computer operating system, and mobile operating system
* Recruiter (team member name)

#### Task Planning

As with your cognitive walkthrough evaluation, you should plan a series of tasks for your user to complete using your interface. Each task should have a clear description, goal, and end-point. You should write as many tasks as you feel are necessary to adequately evaluate the usability of your interface. Since this number will vary greatly depending on your scenario, it is difficult to predict how many each team will need. In general, if you have a sufficiently complex user interface and only prepare 1 or 2 tasks, then it is safe to say that you have not fully evaluated your user interface. You are free to design your tasks for either one, both, or a combination of your prototypes (web and mobile).

#### Data Collection
With your testing plan in hand, you will start conducting your usability tests. Present each participant with the exact same introduction (scope, purpose, session detail, etc.) and tasks. If you discover an error with your first participant, do not fix it for the remaining participants unless it is critical to the success of your study (more on this below).

For each user evaluation session, you will collect the following data:

* Task completion results:
	* Did the user successfully complete the task? If not, what happened?
* Errors:
	* Did the user make any mistakes during the task?
	* Did the user encounter errors in the prototype during the task? If so, what happened?
* Time per task:
	* How long did it take the user to complete the task?
* Notes from user reflection:
	* Likes
	* Dislikes
	* Suggestions or recommendations for improving interface
	* Any other subjective data you would like to collect from your user.

Finally, before you conduct your first study, be sure to run at least 1 pilot study with your group. You want to be absolutely sure that everything will work as intended, consistently across all of your participants. A good approach is to pick a member to act as participant and guide them through each task. Try to think about the different ways that someone new to your work might interact with your prototype to ensure that all interactions work properly.

#### Analysis of Results

For your analysis, you will divide your results into two categories: quantitative and qualitative. Your quantitative results will include task completion results, errors, and time per task. These should fit nicely within a table or spreadsheet so that you can get a holistic view of your results across all participants. Once your data is aggregated, you will summarize the results using the following metrics:

1. Average time per task
2. Task completion rate per user
3. Average user error per task

Your qualitative results will include your observation notes and reflection with each participant. Since this is qualitative data, you will need to use your expertise to develop insights about your user interface. Were there common points in your interface where participants stumbled? Was there a feature that participants liked or disliked? Did you observe any unexpected participant behavior that could be improved through changes to your UI? If so, summarize your qualitative analysis in one or two paragraphs and list out the changes you have decided to make. NOTE: You do not have to make these changes!

## Submission

To submit your functional prototype, appoint one member of your group to be responsible for assembling your final deliverable into a single packet in the PDF format. The packet must start with a cover page that includes (feel free to reuse from a3):

* Your team name
* Scenario summary (one sentence that describes your product)
* Team member names
* Team member roles for this assignment
* Date

Your submission must include the following items:
* Test Plan:
	* Participant demographics
	* Tasks used for evaluation
	* Date and time of each participant study
* Study Analysis:
	* Quantitative results
	* Qualitative results (you do not need to include your notes, just summary)
	* Summary of planned actions
* Overview of functional prototype for web:
	* Link to your source files (either zipped and uploaded with submission or link to live prototype)
	* One or two screen shots that depict your final prototype with descriptions
* Overview of functional prototype for mobile:
	* Link to your source files (either zipped and uploaded with submission or link to live prototype)
	* One or two screen shots that depict your final prototype with descriptions

## Grading

Your team will be given an overall grade that is based on the completeness of your submission. 

* All materials submitted on time: 0.5 pts
* Submission format requirements met: 0.5 pts
* Completeness of web prototype: 9 pts
* Completeness of mobile prototype: 9 pts
* All requirements for user evaluation met: 10 pts
* Novelty and creativity of your final product: 1 pts

Total: 30 pts
