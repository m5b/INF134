A4: Roll Your Own - Simple App
============================

## Overview

Alright. The moment you have all been waiting for!!! Time to bring all of your widgets together into a (semi) functional app.

```{code-cell}

```
## Assignment Details

Now that your toolkit is complete, you will assemble all of your widgets into a single program to demonstrate their functionality. This program does not have to do anything in particular, but it does require that all of your widgets work together to serve a purpose. Generally, what will work best is to build an application around the novel widget that you created for A3. Use your other widgets to provide information, add interaction and interactivity, and support the goals of whatever you decide to create.

## Assignment Requirements

You are free to create whatever you want for this assignment. You do not have to get approval for your app idea. However, there are a few requirements that your app idea must fulfill.

1. You must make real-world practical use of at least 3 of your common widgets (e.g., button, checkbox, radiobutton). You are free to use the heading widget that was provided in your starter repository, but it does not contribute to the three widget minimum.

2. You must integrate your novel widget into the application in a meaningful way. Meaningful integration means that your widget (and supporting common widgets) actually __do something__. It's not enough to just have each widget print to the console or change a heading or color when acted upon. They must all work together to serve a purpose within your application.

3. You must make use of the grid-based layout engine [grid layout engine](../notes/wk8) discussed in class on Monday 5/22. Your entire application does not need to be laid out using the grid, but some portion of it should be. For example, you may choose to use absolute positioning to place your novel widget, but use the grid layout engine to arrange a button and textbox.

4. All of the widgets used in your application must define the correct Aria roles. Remember, as we discussed in class, you will need to lookup the correct role type for each of your widgets and be sure they are assigned in your widget's constructor. If an ARIA type does not exist in the toolkit for your widget, you will have to manually add it to the **`RoleType`** enum in your **`ui.ts`** file. A list of ARIA role types can be found at the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles).

That's it! If you would like to brainstorm or discuss app ideas feel free to reach out to the course staff or open a dialog on Slack. 

### Demo Program

Your completed app should be fully functional when submitted. Zip up your entire project directory as usual, but make sure you keep all files in your **`/dist`** directory in place. If your app requires help or guidance of some sort to use, be sure to include documentation (readme, tooltips, help, etc.) so that others will know how to use it.

## Submission

For this assignment you will submit the following items as a zip file to Canvas:

1. Your completed application `**.ts**` files along with the rest of the starter code as a zip file to Canvas.

2. A revised index.ts or other file that contains your demo app. 

3. A screenshot of your app as it is rendered in the browser. Name your screenshot toolkit_myapp.png (or .jpg, .gif, etc) and place it in the root of your project folder.

Remember to delete all generated files during the setup process (e.g., node_modules) to keep your file size small.

## Grading

Your assignment will be given an overall grade that is based on the completeness of the following items:

* All materials submitted correctly with documentation: 0.25 pts
    * Is a screenshot of the widget and UI included?
* Demo: 0.25 pts
    * Is an index.ts or other page completed so that a full demonstration of the app is available?
    * Does the demo include documentation or otherwise intuitive to use?
* Completeness of app: 1.0 pts 
	* Does the app make use of 3 common widgets and 1 novel widget?
    * Do the app widgets have appropriate ARIA role types assigned?
* Design: 1.5 pts
    * Does the app and all of its widgets work together to perform a common goal or set of actions?
* Grid Layout: 2 pts 
	* Does the app make use of the provided grid layout engine?

Total: 5/5 pts
