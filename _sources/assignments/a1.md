A0: Introductions and Survey
============================

## Introductions

```{note}
To learn more about how to join Zulip, read the course syllabus on Canvas.
```
Learning in a virtual remote setting makes getting to know each other quite challenging. So to facilitate our engagement with one another, you should first introduce yourself in Zulip. 

We have created an #introductions stream in our Zulip workspace. So before our live class on on Jan. 4, join the introductions channel and provide us with one or two fun and interesting facts about yourself.

## Survey

So that we can build the best teams possible, take a few minutes to complete the Skills Survey on Canvas. Your answers will help us ensure that every team has a good mixture of skills and interests, while also be located in reasonably close time zones. 

Survey responses are due by the end of the second day of class (Jan 6th). We will announce team assignments the following Monday.

## Submission

This assignment does not have a traditional submission. Instead, you must sign up for Zulip and introduce yourself, and complete the survey on Canvas.

## Grading

Both parts of this assignment are mandatory and must be completed to pass the class.

* Join Zulip and introduce yourself: 1 pt
* Complete Canvas survey: 1 pt

Total: 2 pts
