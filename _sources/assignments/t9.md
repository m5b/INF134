T9: Final Project Report
============================

## Overview

Congratulations, you have finally reached the end of the team project for Software User Interfaces! By this point, you likely have completed all of the work necessary for your final submission. So this overview will serve as a brief guide to make sure you have everything packaged up in an easy to review format.

## Requirements

Your final submission must include all of the following:

1. Introduction
2. Journey
3. Functional Prototype and Demo Video
4. Future Work

All items should be prepared using either Microsoft PowerPoint or Google Slides. If you use Google Slides, you must generate a PDF version for submission with a link to your live deck in the introduction.

### Introduction

For your introduction start with an overview that includes the name of your product, team members and roles, your problem statement, and a brief description of the product you designed to address your problem.

### Journey

Your journey should cover all relevant assets and artifacts created that led to your final product. Unlike earlier assignments, you do not need to include everything you created. Rather, focus on telling a story by taking the reader through the most poignant moments that influenced the direction of your product. So, for example, if you created three storyboards but only one of them is representative of your final work, then you only need to include the most relevant one.

A key part of your journey should include your user evaluations. In addition to your assets and artifacts, you should explain to the user how the data from your evaluations led to your final product. Again, this is not a rehash of your user evaluation assignment, but rather a thoughtful synthesis of how the analysis of your evaluation data shaped the product you created.

### Functional Prototype and Demo Video

Since most of you will be building out your product using a variety of different tooling you will need to create a recording of all aspects of your final product. Even though you will submit your code, we will likely not run it directly unless there is a need to explore something more deeply than your video allows. Therefore, your video should provide a thorough and detailed view of your final product. Each feature that you demonstrate should be accompanied with either captions or voice explanations so we can map the output back to your journey.

### Future Work

Your report should conclude with a summary and look to the future. In one or two slides, discuss the work that remains to finish your product and what you think your product will look like in the near future. You should have some fun with this section as it requires quite a bit of speculation. 


## Submission

Combine your report, demo video, and functional prototype code into a single zip file. Organize each file into their own directories so that when we unzip your submission we see the following structure:

[TEAM_PROJECT].zip

: /report/[NAME_OF_YOUR_REPORT].pdf (or pptx)
: /demo/[NAME_OF_YOUR_DEMO_VIDEO]
: /prototype/[NAME_OF_YOUR_PROTOTYPE]

Note that all files required to run your code should be placed within the 'prototype' directory. Please remove all unnecessary files (e.g., node_modules) required to build and run your project to keep your file size down.

Take care to record your video with a codec or compression that is not gigabytes in size or you will have trouble uploading to Canvas. If you prefer to upload your video to YouTube or YUJA feel free, just be sure to include a readme file in your demo directory that contains a link to your final video.

Once all required materials are in place and compressed, submit to Canvas. NOTE: We will not make special accommodations for those of you who fail to structure and organize your submission properly. There simply is not enough time to circle back and forth with you to ensure we have the right files. So be sure to test your submission before uploading.

## Grading


The following criteria will be used to grade your final assignment.

* All materials submitted on time: 5 pts
* Submission format requirements met: 2.5 pts
* Quality and professionalism of slide deck: 7.5 pts
* Functional prototype that explores novel user interaction: 15 pts
    * Novelty of user interface and interactions: 5 pts
    * Functional prototype functions as expected: 5 pts
    * Overall completeness of product (compared to other projects): 5 pts


Total: 30 pts
