Design Notebook
============================

## Overview

For this assignment, you will begin to look at the world with "designer's eyes," reflecting on the things with which you interact, and the quality of that interaction.

As you move about your day, pay attention to anything and everything with which you interact and reflect on how the interaction unfolds. You might find yourself frustrated with a new software interface or delighted by the ease of opening a new bottle of milk. The objects you select are not important, as long as they are something with which you interact.

The goal of this notebook is to help you to re-examine how you see the world and the objects within it, to consider why an interaction is good, and how an interaction breaks down. 

## How to Reflect

Once you have selected an object, think about the steps that you took to carry out an interaction with it.

* Was the interaction successful? Why or why not?
* Do you use the object with conscious thought or are you able to remain focused on other goals and activities without thinking about it?
* When the interaction is successful, what properties about its design support that outcome?
* When the interaction is unsuccessful, what types of workarounds do you employ to achieve your goal?

## Submission Requirements

You will be required to submit 5 reports by the end of each Monday for the first five weeks of the course. Each submission will consist of a report on **two** objects that you interacted with during the week.

Your report should consist of all of the following:

* At least one sketch or photograph of each of your two objects.
* A brief description of what the object is and how you use it.
* A one or two paragraph reflection on your experience interacting with the object.
* A short description or sketch of how you might improve your experience.


The following examples should provide you with a rough idea of the structure and length of a good design observation and entry (credit: these are examples provided in an earlier version of this course created by [Professor Donald J. Patterson](https://www.djp3.net/))

Examples
: [Example 1](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~djp3/classes/2011_09_INF133/Assignments/DesignNotebookExamples.pdf)
: [Example 2](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~djp3/classes/2013_01_INF134/journalExample.pdf)

The format that you choose is up to you, as long as the final version is a PDF. If you prefer to use pen and paper, then take a picture of each page and create a PDF. Otherwise, a simple text document with embedded images will suffice.

## Grading

Your design notebook will be graded after each submission. To receive full credit, your reports must demonstrate thoughtful reflection that draws upon what you will be learning in class. A strong submission should consist of roughly a half page of written reflection and one or two visuals that support your reflection.
