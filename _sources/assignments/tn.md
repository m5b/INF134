T3: Development Check-In
============================

## Overview

Every team has its ebbs and flows over the course of a project. There will be bursts of productivity where you come together as a team with clear thought and creativity to make progress. And there will be stretches of time where you are idle, stuck on a problem, or simply unable to find time to meet. Regardless of how much you have produced so far this quarter, we want to know how things are going. In addition to your mid-quarter and final reports, there will be three development check-ins this quarter. This is the first.

## Assignment Details

## Submission

Submit your check-in as a single single PDF document with clear headings to differentitate each section.

We won't expect this document to fill more than a single page, but if you would like to include figures or diagrams (screenshots, code, pictures, etc.) then a few extra pages is fine.

## Grading

The following criteria will be used to grade your final assignment.

 * Submission format requirements met: 0.25 pts
