A2: Scenario Story
============================

## Overview

Now that you have had a chance to get to know your team and settle on a scenario, it's time to start designing your system. For this assignment, you will be identifying the content needed to fulfill your requirements from assignment 1 and flesh out how it will be presented to end users. We will be applying a mobile first approach to product design and development, so thinking through the core needs of a mobile user should be your starting point.

## Assignment Details

### Getting Started

At this point you should have a rough idea of the direction you plan to head with your scenario. To help you refine that direction you will start by applying the ideation and brainstorming techniques we discussed in lecture. Your goal here should be to generate as many assets as possible to help guide your direction. These assets may include sketches and notes, but should also include storyboards.

Think about the different situations in which you might envision a person using your product. Are there any that you are unsure about? Any that you could benefit from some evaluation? If so, explore these situations through storyboards. For example, for my Drone Burrito Delivery Service (DBDS) I need to determine the best way to get the burrito from the drone to the customer. So I might create a series of storyboards that explore this situation:

* Delivery stations?
* Drop and go?
* Table service?

Once you have a few storyboards together, spend some time asking those around you for their thoughts. You can discuss with your team, friends and family, and other groups during class work time. Take note of who you asked to evaluate and their responses.

### Developing Content

Once you have a received some feedback on your preliminary ideas, you will start thinking about the type of content your product will need.
Starting with a mobile first approach, you will start by assembling a list of the content that will be presented to users in your mobile interface. This might be as simple as a bulleted list of one to two word descriptions. For example, with DBDS I might start with the following list:

* App Name
* Menu items
* Delivery location
* Special deals
* Where's my burrito?
* Checkout/pay
* Account/login

Identifying content is a good group exercise, so you will likely want to find time to work together on this part of the assignment.

Once your mobile content has been identified, you should start thinking about what additional features you might include on your website:

* Become a drone sponsor
* Drone fleet management (for vendors)
* Report an issue
* Order replacement drone parts

As you work through your content, remember, at this stage content selection can be fluid. As you work towards functional prototypes you may decide to add or remove these items. So you don't have to get it right the first time through.

### Low-Fidelity Wireframes

Now that you have some content in place, it's time to start thinking about the layout. For this assignment, your low-fidelity wireframes should either be hand sketches or simple digital arrangements using a tool like PowerPoint. You should attempt to wireframe as many user-facing screens as possible. 

Since your individual scenarios will influence how many wireframes are needed, there is no hard requirement on wireframe count. Rather, simply make your best effort to identify and layout all interfaces necessary to build your product. In your final submission, we should be able to follow how your program will function by looking at your wireframes.

### Evaluation Notes

As you spend time in and out of class communicating your story with other people, you should be taking notes on the feedback that you receive. As a team, you will aggregate these notes into a single document that includes the following:

* A description of which assets your shared with the evaluating team.
* A bulleted list of the feedback that you received and an anonymized description of the person that provided the feedback.
* A summary of how you plan to handle the feedback:
	* What will you change? Why?


## Requirements

Your team must have at least three assets per team member, though a thorough story should not be limited by attempting to fulfill the bare minimum. If you are ideating and sketching ideas both individually and collaboratively, you should have no problem generating more than three assets.

Your completed story must contain the following items:

* Artifacts from your ideation process (sketches, notes, pictures, etc., identified by individual team members)
* At least 1 storyboard per team member (everyone must create a storyboard, if you create a storyboard collaboratively then add the names of all members involved)
* At least 1 low-fidelity conceptual wireframe per team member (everyone must create a wireframe, if you create a wireframe collaboratively then add the names of all members involved)

You must also include finalized low-fidelity wireframes that indicate the direction you plan to head with your product. These may or may not be the same as your conceptual wireframes. Your wireframes can change, but should be formalized enough to help you transition to high-fidelity work in assignment 3.

* Final low-fidelity wireframes for your mobile interface
* Final low-fidelity wireframes for your web interface

## Submission

To submit your scenario story, appoint one member of your group to be responsible for assembling your final deliverable into a single packet in the PDF format. The packet must start with a cover page that includes:

* Your team name
* Scenario summary (one sentence that describes your product)
* Team member names
* Date

You must also identify each asset that you created in some way. One approach might be to put your name at the bottom of the page (e.g., created by Mark Baldwin). Alternatively, you may group assets by team member and start each section with an introduction page that includes your name. We are not particularly concerned with how you identify your assets, but simply that you do.

## Grading

Your team will be given an overall grade that is based on thoroughness and thoughtfulness of your story. It is fairly easy to identify rushed or poorly thought out work, so do not wait to the last minute to finalize your assets.

* All materials submitted on time: 0.5 pts
* Submission format requirements met: 0.5 pts
* Completeness of assignment: 9 pts

Total: 10 pts

We will not be penalizing your team for the absence of individual member materials. Missing assets for individual members will be assessed through the participation grade.
