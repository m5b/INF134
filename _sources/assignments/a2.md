A2: Scenario Story
============================

## Overview

Now that you have had a chance to get to know your team and settle on a scenario, it's time to start designing your system. We will be applying a mobile first approach to product development, so 


## Scenario Selection

Once you have been assigned to a team, you will need to meet and discuss which scenario you would like to work on for the course. You will also want to decide how you plan on implementing your functional prototypes. Figma? JavaScript, HTML, and CSS? A web framework like Angular or Ionic? It's up to you which tool you want to use, but you should take into consideration the skills, interests, and desires of your entire team.

Once you have a plan, write it down. For those of you that took INF 133 in Fall 2020, the structure of this document should look familiar. 

You will submit document in PDF format to canvas that includes the following information:


Overview
: A high level description of your project. Start with the scenario that you selected followed by an overview conveys the projectâ€™s purpose in one 3-5 sentence paragraph. You should describe at a high level what you intend to build (e.g., a tweet analysis application), what technologies your project will be used (e.g., JavaScript, TypeScript, and Web), and its purpose (e.g., to help researchers analyze tweets). This is where you should start to mold your chosen scenario into something unique to your group. It is not sufficient to simply restate the scenario. You should build upon it and make it your own.

Requirements
: A low level detailed overview of the features you intend to implement. The requirements section is where you will need to focus most of your attention for this part of the final project. You must be specific enough so that if you were to hand off your requirements to a classmate, they would be able to build your project. 

Team
: The names and roles of each member in your group. If you decide to form a group, a good approach to managing your project is to assign responsibilities to each member. So for example:

    Mark: Write all the HTML/CSS required for the project.

    Brian: Write the Tweet API using jQuery and JavaScript.

    Samantha: Design and layout

For now, don't worry too much about scope. We will work together to refine your requirements as we move throughout the quarter. You are not expected to get this type of document right the first time. A more accurate representation of what you will build will develop as you move through each assignment. So do your best for now to think about how a web, mobile, and speculative interface might be used to fulfill the goals of your chosen scenario.
