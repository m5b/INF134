A2: Five and Five
============================

## Overview

You interact with widgets in a user interface nearly every day, but have you taken the time to understand what makes your interaction successful? Unsuccessful? To build usable interfaces, you must be able to assess what makes them usable. So, for this assignment, you will collect ten examples of physical or graphical widgets, five good and five bad, that you interact with through the interfaces that you use day to day.

## Assignment Details

### Getting Started

You should get started on this assignment as soon as possible. If you try to rush through the requirements as the deadline approaches, you are not going to have the time to reflect on and evaluate your selected widgets effectively. The goal of this exercise is to build a foundational understanding about why some widgets work better than others, this takes time. 

The following example widgets should give you an idea of what to look out for:

Tooltip
 : Unsuccessful - A tooltip has so much text that it can't be read before the bounding window disappears, requiring the user to move the mouse outside the trigger area and back inside again to re-raise the tooltip.

Cascading Menu
 : Unsuccessful - A cascading menu is too small and the structure too deep to accurately select sub-menu items, requiring multiple attempts to accurately select the desired item.

Toggle Button 
 : Successful - The toggle widget used in Windows 10 settings makes it easy to quickly glance at an option and assess whether it is on or off, the background color of the widget changes to a highlight color when the toggle is on.

Take a few moments to think about the individual widgets that make up the graphical interfaces on your computer, tablet, or smartphone and note whether or not you find the interaction successful. Once you have collected five successful and five unsuccessful widgets you are ready to move on to the next section.

### Evaluating Your Widgets

At this point you _know_ something about the widgets you collected, after all, you selected them for a reason, right? Either some step in your widget interaction caused a breakdown or your interaction was successful. Now you need to understand _why_ and be able to explain it to others using common HCI evaluation methods.

You have likely been asked to apply [Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) to user interfaces in other classes. However, unlike your previous application of heuristics, for this assignment you will be solely focused on evaluating an individual widget rather than an entire user interface. So make sure that the interactions that you select are constrained to a single graphical widget.

You will use the Usability Aspect Report (<a href="../resources/UAR_TEMPLATE.doc">UAR Template</a>) format developed by Brad A. Myers and Bonnie John to document each of your widgets. You should use one report per widget, but aggregate all reports into a single document.

## Submission

To submit your report, convert your final report into PDF format and submit to the Canvas assignment page.

## Grading

You will be given an overall grade that is based on thoroughness and thoughtfulness of your story. It is fairly easy to identify rushed or poorly thought out work, so do not wait to the last minute to finalize your widgets.
