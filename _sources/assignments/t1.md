T1: Web Frameworks and Graphical Toolkits
============================

## Overview

The landscape for building graphical software is filled with a myriad of solutions designed to support the development of mobile and desktop interfaces. Deciding which one to use is often filled with numerous variables that must be taken into consideration. Understanding the differences between web and native tools, frameworks and toolkits, and their underlying designs is an important step in the software user interface development process. For your first team assignment, you will be conducting a survey of user interface web frameworks and native graphical toolkits. You will collectively decide on 1 web framework and 1 native graphical toolkit to report on. Once your team has settled on a framework and toolkit, you will put together a brief slide deck and present your findings in class.

## Assignment Details

Each team is responsible for reporting on 1 web framework and 1 native graphical toolkit. A good approach to deciding on your tools is to spend some time individually investigating what exists. Identify two or three examples and share them with your team. When ready, get together and discuss which framework and toolkit you would like to report on to the class.

### What is a Web Framework?

For this assignment we will define a web framework as tooling that enables someone to develop graphical user interfaces that run in a web browser. You may encounter some frameworks that refer to themselves as libraries rather than web frameworks, generally, this is a semantic distinction. While frameworks do tend to be larger and more feature rich, as long as the tool makes it possible to build an interface for the web, it is perfectly acceptable to report on it.

### What is a Native Graphical Toolkit?

A native toolkit is a type of tooling that enables someone to develop graphical user interfaces that run natively in a computing environment. You are free to report on native toolkits for desktop computing or mobile devices.

Once you have settled on your tooling, be sure to sign up using the course spreadsheet (This is the same sheet we have been using for project team assignments. The link has been sent as a Canvas announcement and shared on Zulip). Each team must report on unique tools for both web frameworks and native toolkits. So before you start working on your report, check the spreadsheet to make sure your topics have not already been selected!

```{note}
You are not allowed to report on a web framework or native toolkit that has already been selected by another team! Check the course spreadsheet and enter your desired tooling before you start working on your report.
```

## Presentation

Each team will present their report to the class on Thursday 4/15. You should plan on talking for 5 minutes. If your presentation exceeds 5 minutes you will be stopped, so be sure to practice with your team a few times to make sure you are able to say everything you want within the time limit. This presentation opportunity will contribute to your participation points for the course, so while all team members do not have to speak, you are encouraged to take the mic for at least one slide!

## Submission

Your final report should be created using a presentation tool such as Microsoft PowerPoint or Google Slides. Your slide deck should include the following:

History
: When was it launched?
: Why was it launched (_e.g.,_ what perceived problem was it created to solve)?
: What tool(s) are used for development?
: What OSes does it run on (if native)
: What is the license (_e.g.,_ commercial or open source, if open source, which one)?
: Who created and/or supports it? The answer to this question will vary, but generally either a group of engineers or an organization is behind maintaining and advancing the tool. Tell us who.

Features
: What programming language(s) does it use?
: What are its advantages over similar tools?
: What are its trade-offs?

Sample Code
: Show some sample code and screen shots that describe how someone would create a button and associated event handler with it.

Export your final slide deck as a PDF and submit to canvas by the deadline specified on Canvas.

```{admonition} Presenting vs. Submitting
:class: tip

Note that you will be graded on the thoroughness of your slide deck, not your presentation. If you find that you are unable to cover the entirety of your slide deck within the allotted five minutes, DO NOT remove content from the deck that you submit to Canvas. Rather, you should adjust your presentation by either skipping or summarizing slides that you deem less critical for your audience.

```

## Grading

Your team will be assigned a grade based on the following criteria:

* All materials submitted on time and in the correct format: 0.5 pt
* Presentation of tooling is unique: 0.5 pt
* All requirements specified for the assignment are met: 2 pt

Total: 3 pts
