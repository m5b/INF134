A4: High Fidelity Prototypes
============================

## Overview


## Assignment Details


## Submission

To submit your high fidelity prototypes, appoint one member of your group to be responsible for assembling your final deliverable into a single packet in the PDF format. The packet must start with a cover page that includes (feel free to reuse from a2):

* Your team name
* Scenario summary (one sentence that describes your product)
* Team member names
* NEW: Team member roles for this assignment
* Date

Your submission must include the following items:
* The artifacts you used for your evaluation
* The script(s) used during your evaluation
* A believability report
* A screenshot taken of your recorded session and link to your evaluation recording
* Final high fidelity prototypes and user flow

## Grading

Your team will be given an overall grade that is based on thoroughness and thoughtfulness of your story. It is fairly easy to identify rushed or poorly thought out work, so do not wait to the last minute to finalize your assets.

* All materials submitted on time: 0.5 pts
* Submission format requirements met: 0.5 pts
* Completeness of assignment: 9 pts
	* Are all views represented in high fidelity prototypes?
	* Are all evaluations complete?

Total: 10 pts

We will not be penalizing your team for the absence of individual member materials. Missing assets for individual members will be assessed through the participation grade.
