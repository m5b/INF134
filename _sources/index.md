Project in User Interaction Software
============================

## Course Overview
Welcome to INF 134: Project in User Interaction Software. Here you will find all learning materials for the course. Assignment descriptions, lecture notes, links to lecture videos, references, and other learning related information will be located here.

As we are virtual remote this quarter, we wanted to simplify access to learning materials for you. We are using the Jupyter Book format because it provides a rich format for sharing, viewing, and consuming technical information. In the upper right side of this website you will find a link that allows you to download the entire book in Markdown or PDF format. Feel free to use this feature if you need an offline copy of course materials. I will be updating this website frequently as we work our way through the class. So be sure to check back at least once a week. However, when major updates do occur, an announcement will be sent in the [course discussion workspace](https://inf134.zulipchat.com/).

### Course Description

From the catalog:

> Students complete an end-to-end user interface programming project based on an iterative design paradigm. Topics may include requirements brainstorming, paper prototyping, iterative development, cognitive walk-through, quantitative evaluation, and acceptance testing. 
		
In practice, every instructor takes a slightly different bend to these topics. I focus on covering core concepts and practices that lead to well-designed, inclusive software user interfaces. We will develop and strengthen prototyping skills, build upon the mobile and web development programming experience gained in INF 133, and explore alternative forms of user interface design.
		
### Learning Objectives
		
At the end of this course, students should be able to:

* Identify, describe, and improve shortcomings in common user interfaces.
* Choose an appropriate prototyping tool to validate user interface designs.
* Rapidly iterate on user interface designs using various prototyping techniques.
* Evaluate user interactions with prototypes and functional user interfaces.
* Implement and articulate best practices for successful and inclusive software user interfaces.
														
### Required Text and Materials
														
Given the rapid changes in user interface development, any materials relying on a particular technology will quickly lose their value as a reference material. Articles online serve as a great resource, and all required materials will be made available. Check the resources section for some pointers, and feel free to send the course staff any resources you find useful as the course progresses.

There will be some required readings interspersed throughout the quarter that relate to the lecture topics. Links to select readings will be posted alongside weekly lecture notes.

### Assignments

Assignment details will be posted as the quarter progresses. When a new assignment overview page is posted, the corresponding assignment title below will be updated with a link to the assignment page. You will also see a link to the page appear in the navigation bar to the left.

### Design Notebooks

A design notebook is simply a written record (a notebook, piece of paper, digital document, etc.) of an engagement with a particular designed object. For this course, you will focus you design jottings on user interface successes, or failures, that you experience while interacting with objects throughout the week.

Although you are welcome to record your experience with a software interface, the built world is filled with rewarding and frustrating interactions that are worth consideration. So as you go about your week, take a minute to consider how you feel about the types of designed objects you interact with on a daily basis. Write your observations down and submit them as a PDF on Canvas at the start of each week.

### Exams

There are no formal exams for this course.

### Participation

Although we are a virtual class this quarter, our goal is to reproduce as much of the classroom experience as possible. So we will be using an online quiz tool called Socrative throughout the quarter to keep track of our progress together and have a little fun. We will also have a course Zulip workspace where we can chat and learn from each other.

Socrative quiz sessions will occur live during our regular meeting time every Tuesday. Each quiz may contain questions relating to course material, discussions, and your overall thoughts on the class. These quizzes are designed to be low-stakes and fun, but will also contribute to a participation grade for the class. 

Zulip will be our primary tool for communication. You will be expected to join the class workspace and participate in informal discussions during the quarter.

### Lecture Notes

As we move through each week, I will be adding weekly notes pages from both prerecorded lectures, live lectures, (available on Canvas) and discussions that we have with each other. New lecture note pages will be posted every Wednesday. The topics we will be discussing each week are listed in the next section. 

## Quarter at a Glance

```{note}
The following schedule is subject to change throughout the quarter.
```

We have tried to keep due dates for all assignments consistent throughout the quarter. For the first 5 weeks, you will individually submit your design notebooks by end of day on Monday. All other assignments will also be due by end of day on Monday with the exception of the skills survey and final assignment.
