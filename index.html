<h2>Course Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#course-overview" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Greetings and welcome to INF 134!</p>
<p>The past two years have been an unusual period for learning, certainly unlike anything any of us have experienced before. The plan for this course is largely set, however, we recognize that with COVID-19 affecting all aspects of our daily lives the next ten weeks might hold some uncertainty. So, I want to say that in unusual circumstances, the criteria and planning for this course could change. We won’t make changes arbitrarily, but the world has had a lot of special circumstances lately and we’d like everyone to try to be flexible, rolling as best we can with the punches that come our way.</p>
<p>The plan, for now, is to run INF 134 as a traditional in-person course. We will record lectures, when they occur, but only as a backup. Classes will be about 60 percent lecture and 40 percent group and class work. Many classes will simply not be captured well using the recording tools at our disposal. Therefore, you will be expected to attend every class this quarter.  Your course staff will accommodate sickness and travel as it arises, but do not expect to be able to complete this course in a virtual-remote setting.</p>
<p>For this quarter, we will be making use of four different tools:</p>
<dl class="simple myst">
<dt>Canvas</dt><dd><p>Consider Canvas your launch point. It is where you will submit your assignments, view your grades, and find recorded lecture videos.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Project Website (<a class="reference external" href="https://inf134.markbaldw.in">https://inf134.markbaldw.in</a>)</dt><dd><p>All assignment materials, weekly notes, and course updates will be posted here.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Zulip (or Slack or Discord or whatever)</dt><dd><p>I don’t like email. If you have taken a class with me before you are by now quite familiar with my feelings about the communication tool Zulip. Despite nearly all of my students lamenting its existence, Zulip has served me well for three academic years! That said, I don’t expect that I will need the unique features of Zulip for this class. Nevertheless, a real time communication tool is always helpful for quick or async interactions. So, the first day of class, we will decide together which tool to use.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I strongly encourage you to take some time over the first few days of the quarter to read through the syllabus and familiarize yourself with the various platforms listed above. If you have any questions or concerns please let us know.</p>
</section>
<section id="course-goals-and-learning-outcomes">
<h2>Course goals and learning outcomes<a class="headerlink" href="#course-goals-and-learning-outcomes" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>From the catalog:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Students complete an end-to-end user interface programming project based on an iterative design paradigm. Topics may include requirements brainstorming, paper prototyping, iterative development, cognitive walk-through, quantitative evaluation, and acceptance testing.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In practice, every instructor takes a slightly different bend to these topics. I focus on covering core concepts and practices that lead to well-designed, inclusive software user interfaces. We will develop and strengthen prototyping skills, build upon the mobile and web development programming experience gained in INF 133, and explore alternative forms of user interface design.</p>
<section id="learning-objectives">
<h3>Learning Objectives¶<a class="headerlink" href="#learning-objectives" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>At the end of this course, students should be able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Identify, describe, and improve shortcomings in common user interfaces.</p></li>
<li><p>Describe how user interface toolkits are built from graphical primitives.</p></li>
<li><p>Rapidly iterate on user interface designs using various prototyping techniques.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate user interactions with prototypes and functional user interfaces.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement and articulate best practices for successful and inclusive software user interfaces.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Meeting Place and Times<a class="headerlink" href="#meeting-place-and-times" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Lecture is officially scheduled to meet Monday and Wednesday from <strong>5:00 p.m. to 6:20 p.m.</strong> in <a class="reference external" href="https://classrooms.uci.edu/classrooms/mstb/mstb-118/">MSTB 118</a>.</p>
<p>If you need to make contact with us outside of class, you may email us directly using the email addresses listed on the Canvas version of the syllabus (left off here for privacy). Note, to ensure that we receive your email in a timely manner, start the subject line with “INF 134”. We receive a great deal of email each day, so to ensure that we attend to your requests efficiently, we filter all emails with INF 134 in the subject. If you don’t use the INF 134 keyword, you might not hear from us as quickly as you would like.</p>
<section id="office-hours">
<h3>Office Hours<a class="headerlink" href="#office-hours" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>We will all have office hours by appointment, just drop us an email or catch us before or after class to schedule a time to meet. Otherwise, the quickest and most effective way to reach us is by email or [Course Live Chat] DM; the quickest way to get most course-related questions answered is through direct messages.</p>

<section id="participation-and-late-policy">
<h3>Participation and Late Policy<a class="headerlink" href="#participation-and-late-policy" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>For this course, the late submission of assignments is considered a part of your overall course participation score. If you are unable to complete an assignment on time you are eligible for an automatic extension if you notify course staff before the assignment is due. Failure to notify the course staff will result in a 0 for any late assignment. Once notified, all extensions will expire at the same time the next assignment is due. In other words, if you submit A1 after the A2 deadline, you will receive a 0 for A1. Generally, this gives you about two weeks to wrap up an overdue assignment. However, not all assignments are spaced equally, so be sure to check first.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether or not you receive an exception, your assignment is still considered late. The submission of late assignments will affect your participation score. Please review the participation rubric for details on how late submissions can affect your grade.</p>
<p>Participation will also be determined by your involvement in group assignments. Individual activity within a group will be self-monitored by group members and reported via Canvas survey. A combination of the score your group assigns to you and your participation in each survey will be factored into your final participation grade.</p>

<section id="attendance">
<h3>Attendance<a class="headerlink" href="#attendance" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>We have done our best to design this course to work alongside the uncertainty of COVID-19. Realistically, there are some of you that will be unable to attend in-person, some of you might get sick and need to quarantine.</p>
<p>If you are unable to attend in-person classes for any reason, please be aware that you must request an attendance exemption from either the university or from the course staff:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If you are sick or otherwise unable to attend class, you can request an exemption via email or chat DM.</p></li>
<li><p>If your situation is related to a disability or medical condition please reach out to Disability Services Center: <a class="reference external" href="http://dsc.uci.edu">dsc.uci.edu</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to keep us all safe and ensure that nobody is left out of the learning process is to remain as flexible as possible. So, if you feel sick for any reason do not come to class! If you think you may have been exposed to some one with COVID-19, do not come to class until you have tested negative. You will not be penalized for missing class if you have an approved exemption. All we ask is that if you are going to miss more than one in-person discussion class, let us know! We want to make sure your learning needs are being met so that you do not fall behind.</p>

<section id="recordings">
<h3>Recordings<a class="headerlink" href="#recordings" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>The nature of this course requires student attendance to be successful. We will do our best to record lectures when they occur, but do not expect to be able to complete this course remotely.</p>
</section>
<section id="questions-and-announcements">
<h3>Questions and Announcements<a class="headerlink" href="#questions-and-announcements" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>We’ll use the course Chat workspace for public course-related questions. If you have an individual issue you’d like to raise with course staff, send us a direct message via email or [Course Live Chat].</p>
<p>We will never intentionally ignore a message, so if you don’t receive a response, write again; sometimes overactive spam filters snag a legitimate message. Using course-specific subject lines and your UCInet email address will help your messages get noticed.</p>
<p>We may also send course announcements by email to the official course mailing list, so you should check your email regularly. Note that this mailing list goes to the email address that the registrar has for you (your UCInet ID). If you prefer to read your email on another account, you should set your UCInet account to forward your email to your preferred account (see how in the Advice section). Don’t let this slide; if you miss official announcements, your grade could suffer.</p>

<section id="readings-and-course-materials">
<h3>Readings and Course Materials<a class="headerlink" href="#readings-and-course-materials" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Given the rapid changes in web and mobile development, any materials relying on a particular technology will quickly lose their value as a reference material. Articles online serve as a great resource, and all required materials will be made available. Check the resources link at the course website for some pointers, and feel free to send the course staff any resources you find useful as the course progresses.</p>
</section>
<section id="course-structure">
<h3>Course structure<a class="headerlink" href="#course-structure" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Your TAs will have primary responsibility for grading your work; go to them first for any questions about grading or scoring. If that does not resolve your question, then see then reach out to me. The TAs and I will be happy to correct any errors that do occur, but we must ask that you bring us your grading questions within a week after the assignment is graded; the course moves quickly and we imply can’t deal with assignments long past. We recommend that you focus not on letter grades but on learning what’s necessary to earn high scores; the grades will follow from that.</p>
<p>Please note, in case of unexpected or unusual circumstances, these criteria could change.</p>

<section id="respect-for-diversity">
<h3>Respect for Diversity<a class="headerlink" href="#respect-for-diversity" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>It is our intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. Our goal is to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups. In addition, if any of our class meetings conflict with your religious events, please let me know so that we can make arrangements for you.</p>
<p>Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation due to a disability should contact the UCI Disability Services Center at (949) 824-7494 as soon as possible to explore the possible range of accommodations. We encourage all students having difficulty, whether or not due to a disability, to consult privately with the instructor at any time.</p>

<section id="good-advice-and-helpful-hints">
<h3>Good advice and helpful hints<a class="headerlink" href="#good-advice-and-helpful-hints" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Check your  email regularly; this is an official channel for course announcements. When sending course-related mail, start the subject line with “INF 134”.</p>
<p>Attendance in class is essential; concepts and issues will come up in class that aren’t easily available from other sources, and those concepts will find their way into the assignments and exams. Also, class participation in various forms will count towards the course grade.</p>
<p>Read each assignment with care, more than once. Reading technical specifications requires different skills than reading non-technical material; acquiring those skills is one goal of this class and one reason it provides General Education credit. Expect to refer back to the assignment often, and check it first when you have questions about what’s required or how to proceed.</p>
<p>Don’t expect to complete every assignment in one sitting, especially not the night before it’s due. If you start early, you’ll have plenty of time to ask questions.</p>

<section id="academic-honesty">
<h3>Academic Honesty<a class="headerlink" href="#academic-honesty" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>As a student enrolled in INF 134, you are expected to know and follow the academic honesty policies of both the Bren School of ICS and the University as a whole. Please take a few minutes to read the policies, which can be found at this link.</p>
<p>All of your work on assignments is expected to be completed by you, unless the assignment explicitly states otherwise (e.g., team project). You are not permitted to work on individual assignments in groups. You are permitted to work with your classmates on higher level discussions relating to course material. However, when it comes time to write code for your assignment, we expect your code to be written by only you. All assignment submissions are automatically compared to each other as well as known examples available on the Internet, a plagiarism alert will be triggered.</p>
<p>All violations of academic honesty policies will be reported to the UCI Office of Academic Integrity &amp; Student Conduct (AISC) and will trigger an administrative procedure, which is described on their web site. Additionally, you can receive a course grade of F — as a number of students in ICS courses do, because of this issue, every quarter — without the option to drop the course to avoid the grade. A single documented case of academic dishonesty may also have other ramifications, such as precluding you from switching into computing majors, registering for computing minors, joining the ICS Honors Program, and graduating from a computing major with honors. All of this is University and Bren School of ICS policy and is not subject to negotiation.</p>
<p>As an instructor, allowing students to share their work online, such as publicly on GitHub, poses a dilemma. The benefit is that it can contribute to your web presence, offering a browseable portfolio piece to potential employers. But it can also serve as an online resource for other current or future students to copy from, rather than learn from. We ask that you do not make your code for individual assignment work (e.g., A1-A4) in this class visible online unless it is significantly distinguishable from the course assignment. You are, however, free to share any and all of the work you complete with your project team.</p>
</section>
<section id="online-resources-and-collaboration">
<h3>Online Resources and Collaboration<a class="headerlink" href="#online-resources-and-collaboration" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you’ll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.</p>
<p>While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. To be clear: looking at or submitting a student’s assignment from a previous course offering is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!</p>
<p>Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does <em>not</em> permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own. Feel free to talk to others, but take a break to ensure you’ve learned from the collaboration rather than copied.</p>
<p>Some of the assignments will be completed in pairs. For these assignments, your pair is treated as though you were one individual. You may use online resources, share code between your pair, etc., but may not attempt to pass off another pair’s work as your own.</p>
