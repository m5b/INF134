10:07:30	 From  Yasvi Patel : *can also suggest sustainable fashion ideas
10:07:57	 From  Dachelle Dainn Alo : We love sustainable and eco-friendly clothing

10:09:20	 From  Michael Collins : what about an app where you can take/use a picture of an outfit and have it reverse image search to find vendors
10:09:39	 From  Matthew Huu-Tri Nguyen : ^ I like that idea

10:21:48	 From  Shannon Hoang : ^ from my memory, we have 10 in total after like five weeks (so for monday, we have 2 reports done)
10:22:06	 From  Shannon Hoang : if i’m wrong, please correct me :) !!
10:22:49	 From  Yingyan Wu : ah okay! the wording on the website was rlly confusing lol “You will be required to submit 5 reports by the end of each Monday for the first five weeks of the course. Each submission will consist of a report on two objects that you interacted with during the week.” hmmmm
10:25:47	 From  Michael Collins : ^ my interpretation is one page-ish per object but a single report of 2 objects
10:26:07	 From  Angela Thuy Do   to   Mark S. Baldwin(Privately) : Is it called Turntable FM?
10:26:33	 From  Shannon Hoang : oh yes, sorry - i meant “description of 2 objects” by “2 reports”
